## Quick Overview

**What does this project do?**

Firstly the project does nothing fancy, it takes the input from user in a form and then the the data will be send over to ProfileServlet to be processed and then be displayed as a simplified card of profile summary.

## Notes

That's it! If someone found this just give it a pass, because this is honestly just an assignment project and not to be taken seriously.
